# What is TexCreate?

TexCreate is a LaTeX project creator developed by Mustafif Khan in 2021 and is actively being maintained as my main portfolio project. The project started from my laziness; I found setting up LaTeX documents annoying whenever I had something new to do (I use LaTeX over word processors). I created a program to write a document for me using some prebuilt templates embedded in the program. When I wrote TexCreate, I found it very useful, and it saved me a lot of time, such as when I used it for a Physics tutorial with the Lachaise template.

When TexCreate was first written, much of the code was written using Github copilot when I got my technical preview. However, as the versions came out, I found myself using an AI less and less, with TexCreate v3 with the whole project totaling around 4000+ lines of code only having one thing written by AI,`cprint!()`.

This project is for anyone who wants to save time creating LaTeX documents! Let's install the application and begin creating!!!!
